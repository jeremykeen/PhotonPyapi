// Same as in the Blink an LED example:
// led1 is D0, led2 is D7

// This time, we are also going to register our Spark function

 Spark.function("led",ledToggle);
 // This is saying that when we ask the cloud for the function "led", it will employ the function ledToggle() from this app.

// Since we're waiting for input through the cloud this time,
// we don't actually need to put anything in the loop

// We're going to have a super cool function now that gets called when a matching API request is sent
// This is the ledToggle function we registered to the "led" Spark.function earlier.

  Since we can pass a string, it means that we can give the program commands on how the function should be used.

  Then, the function returns a value to us to let us know what happened.
  In this case, it will return 1 for the LEDs turning on, 0 for the LEDs turning off,
  and -1 if we received a totally bogus command that didn't do anything to the LEDs.
